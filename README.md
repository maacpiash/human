## 🤷 But why is this repo called `human`?

The previous version of my website was virtually a CLI, almost exactly like the homepage of [Shelley Vohr](https://codebyte.re).

That version received polarizing responses from my friends. My developer friends loved it so much that they wanted to see the source code immediately. On the other hand, everyone else (*human*s) couldn't find a thing about me on that website. My girlfriend was in the latter category.

So, I created this website, as a more _human_-friendly version, that everybody could appreciate.
